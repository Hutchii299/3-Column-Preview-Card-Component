# Frontend Mentor 3-Column Preview Card Component Challenge
Frontend Mentor 3-column preview card component done using a javascript MVC framework and grid auto-fit. By using the grid auto-fit property I allowed for a no media-query responsive design for this challenge.

Using any javascript in this challenge was entirely overkill; however, I wanted to practise the MVC framework. Using javascript, let me reduce HTML code by not having to repeat the code for 3 seperate cards which was beneficial.
